## Sediment accumulation rates

Workflow to spatially predict 210Pb-based sedimentation rates of seafloor sediments of the Norwegian continental shelf and slope. The workflow accounts for areas where erosion and sediment transport occurs by randomly inserting pseudo-samples with a sedimentation rate of 0 cm/yr.

### Model outputs

The following outputs are provided:

* Predicted sediment accumulation rates (cm/yr)

* 90% prediction interval, which can be interpreted as a measure of uncertainty

* Area of applicability of the model [(Meyer & Pebesma, 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13650)
